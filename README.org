#+TITLE: The collector

This project has served its purpose (which was to help making 
[[https://github.com/sajjjadayobi/persianqa][PersianQA Dataset]]).
Therefore, although its not perfect, there won't be much changes to it (unless
someone has a particular issue with it and only I can help with).

* Starting a local version

To clone the repo and initialize it (using [[https://python-poetry.org/][Poetry]]), run:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/davoodeh/thecollector
cd thecollector
poetry install
#+END_SRC

To set required environmental variables, simply use the =env.example.json= file as below:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cp thecollector/env.example.json thecollector/env.json
#+END_SRC

Then replace the =SECRET= with a value created by something like the command below:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
python -c 'import os, base64; print(base64.b64encode(os.urandom(16)).decode("utf-8"))'
#+END_SRC

Finally, the server can be run =-m=:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
poetry run python -m thecollector
#+END_SRC

After that, your instance should be on [[http://127.0.0.1:5000/]].

For more tools/testing you can try checking out =local-= branches, like so:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git checkout local-$branch
#+END_SRC
